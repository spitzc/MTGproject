Magic the gathering: flavor text and power creep

This project analyzes aspects of card data from Magic the Gathering. The two goals are to look at the frequency of words used in flavor text for each set, and calculate the ratio of power to mana cost over time. The flavorText files with set codes provide all flavor text for a specified set, which may be used for word cloud visualizations. The ratioWrite file also creates a json file that may be used for visualizations

Prerequisites:
This requires downloading the All Sets file from mtgjson.com, saved as AllSets.json in the same directory.
